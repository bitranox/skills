> **Versioning note:** In the context of a skills collection (not a traditional software library),
> Semantic Versioning is applied as follows:
>
> - **MAJOR** — Backward-incompatible changes: skills renamed, removed, or restructured in ways
>   that break existing workflows or references.
> - **MINOR** — New skills, new reference documents, or new sync scripts added in a
>   backward-compatible manner.
> - **PATCH** — Fixes, corrections, and small improvements to existing skills or documentation.
