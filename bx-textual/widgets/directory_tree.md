# DirectoryTree

A tree control to navigate the contents of your filesystem.

- [x] Focusable
- [ ] Container


## Example

The example below creates a simple tree to navigate the current working directory.

```python
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import DirectoryTree


class DirectoryTreeApp(App):
    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield DirectoryTree("./")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = DirectoryTreeApp()
    app.run()
```

## Filtering

There may be times where you want to filter what appears in the
`DirectoryTree`. To do this inherit from `DirectoryTree` and implement your
own version of the `filter_paths` method. It should take an iterable of
Python `Path` objects, and return those that pass the filter. For example,
if you wanted to take the above code an filter out all of the "hidden" files
and directories:

**directory_tree_filtered.py**


~~~python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Iterable

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import DirectoryTree


class FilteredDirectoryTree(DirectoryTree):
    def filter_paths(self, paths: Iterable[Path]) -> Iterable[Path]:
        return [path for path in paths if not path.name.startswith(".")]


class DirectoryTreeApp(App):
    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield FilteredDirectoryTree("./")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = DirectoryTreeApp()
    app.run()
~~~
